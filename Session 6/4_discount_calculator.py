# Discount Calculator: Create a program that calculates the total cost after applying a discount 
# based on the following conditions:
# If the purchase amount is greater than $100, apply a 10% discount.
# If the purchase amount is greater than $50 but less than or equal to $100, apply a 5% discount.
# If the purchase amount is less than or equal to $50, apply no discount.
